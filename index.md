## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7
Lab 7 was interesting to me knowing that code can affect real-life situations like setting rules for things such as parking. It was fun to figure out what expressions to use in order to set specific times cars can park according to AM, PM, and the specific minutes connecting how that is interpreted into code. It is shown a significance in how little implementations like these in cities who need parking regulations have today. Iâ€™ve learned more of how test cases are used to test the outcome of the program.

Lab 4
Lab 4 was enjoyable, learning how to create a secret guessing game and learning how to tweak code based on the output. Figuring out conversion between units helped me think about how to build expressions to calculate or convert units properly. These exercises helped me think more about the placement of variables.

Lab 2
Lab 2 was one of the first labs I have done. It was fun to learn about strings and how line wrapping works in order to make sentences appear cohesive when put out. It has helped me realize how to format code better when making sentences and when tracing in general. Testing when seeing what is output was also interesting to figure out when tweaking it.
